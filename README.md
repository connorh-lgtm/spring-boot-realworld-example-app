# ![RealWorld Example App using Java 17 and Spring](example-logo.png)

[![Actions](https://github.com/gothinkster/spring-boot-realworld-example-app/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gothinkster/spring-boot-realworld-example-app/actions)

> ### Spring Boot + MyBatis codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged full-stack application built with **Spring Boot 2.7.18** and **Java 17**, featuring MyBatis for persistence, including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

**ðŸš€ Recently Migrated to Java 17** - This application has been successfully migrated from Java 11 to Java 17 with comprehensive performance optimizations, enhanced security, and modern Java features.

For more information on how this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# *NEW* GraphQL Support  

Following some DDD principles. REST or GraphQL is just a kind of adapter. And the domain layer will be consistent all the time. So this repository implement GraphQL and REST at the same time.

The GraphQL schema is https://github.com/gothinkster/spring-boot-realworld-example-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/schema/schema.graphqls and the visualization looks like below.

And this implementation is using [dgs-framework](https://github.com/Netflix/dgs-framework) which is a quite new java graphql server framework.
# How it works

The application uses Spring Boot (Web, Mybatis).

* Use the idea of Domain Driven Design to separate the business term and infrastructure term.
* Use MyBatis to implement the [Data Mapper](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html) pattern for persistence.
* Use [CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) pattern to separate the read model and write model.

And the code is organized as this:

1. `api` is the web layer implemented by Spring MVC
2. `core` is the business model including entities and services
3. `application` is the high-level services for querying the data transfer objects
4. `infrastructure`  contains all the implementation classes as the technique details

# Security

Integration with Spring Security and add other filter for jwt token process.

The secret key is stored in `application.properties`.

# Database

It uses a ~~H2 in-memory database~~ sqlite database (for easy local test without losing test data after every restart), can be changed easily in the `application.properties` for any other database.

# Getting started

You'll need **Java 17** installed.

    ./gradlew bootRun

To test that it works, open a browser tab at http://localhost:8080/tags .  
Alternatively, you can run

    curl http://localhost:8080/tags

## Performance Testing

Run the comprehensive performance benchmark suite:

    ./gradlew performanceTest

This will execute Java 17 specific performance tests measuring startup time, memory usage, GC performance, and throughput.

# Try it out with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

You'll need Docker installed.
	
    ./gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName spring-boot-realworld-example-app
    docker run -p 8081:8080 spring-boot-realworld-example-app

## Production Deployment with Java 17

For production deployment, use the Java 17 optimized container:

    ./gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName spring-boot-realworld-example-app:java17
    docker run -p 8080:8080 \
      -e JWT_SECRET="your-production-jwt-secret" \
      -e SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE="production" \
      spring-boot-realworld-example-app:java17

See [JAVA_17_DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md](JAVA_17_DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md) for comprehensive production deployment guidance.

# Try it out with a RealWorld frontend

The entry point address of the backend API is at http://localhost:8080, **not** http://localhost:8080/api as some of the frontend documentation suggests.

# Run test

The repository contains comprehensive test coverage including API tests, repository tests, and Java 17 migration validation tests.

    ./gradlew test

## Java 17 Migration Testing

The application includes specialized test suites for Java 17 validation:

- **Migration Validation Tests**: Verify Java 17 compatibility and feature usage
- **Performance Benchmark Tests**: Measure Java 17 performance improvements  
- **GraphQL Integration Tests**: Validate DGS framework compatibility with Java 17
- **Database Integration Tests**: Ensure MyBatis works correctly with Java 17
- **JWT Security Tests**: Verify authentication works with updated JWT libraries

Run specific test categories:

    ./gradlew test --tests "*Java17*"
    ./gradlew performanceTest

# Code format

Use Spotless for code formatting (configured for Java 17 compatibility).

    ./gradlew spotlessJavaApply

The Spotless configuration has been updated to work with Java 17 using Google Java Format 1.17.0 with AOSP style.
